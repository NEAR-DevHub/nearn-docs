## Overview

The sponsor dashboard gives you access to comprehensive key metrics at a glance for your selected sponsor account. You can get an instant overview of the total funds rewarded, the number of active listings you're running, and the total submissions received, helping you track your impact and activity.

## Manage Active Listings

You can view all your created opportunities in one organized space:

### Listing Lifecycles

Listings progress through distinct stages, clearly indicated on your dashboard via their current status:
- **Draft:** The listing has been created but is not yet published.
- **In Progress:** The listing is published and actively accepting submissions.
- **In Review:** The submission deadline has passed, and the sponsor is now reviewing the submissions.
- **Payment Pending:** The sponsor has selected the recipient(s), but payment or verification is still pending.
- **Completed:** The sponsor has processed and verified payment to the recipient(s).
- **Deleted:** The listing has been hidden from the platform (typically an admin action or for listings that are no longer relevant and were never activated/completed).

### Filter and Search

You can easily filter your listings by their [type](../opportunities.md) (Bounties, Projects, Sponsorships) or current status to quickly find what you need.

### Quick Actions & Edits

The listings table offers a clear summary of each opportunity (name, submission count, deadline, prize, status) and provides direct links to edit listings or view their respective submissions, streamlining your management process.
