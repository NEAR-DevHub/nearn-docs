## Overview

The sponsor dashboard gives you access to comprehensive key metrics at a glance for your selected sponsor account. You can get an instant overview of the total funds rewarded, the number of active listings you're running, and the total submissions received, helping you track your impact and activity.

## Manage Active Listings

You can view all your created opportunities in one organized space:

### Listing Lifecycles

Listings progress through distinct stages, clearly indicated on your dashboard via their current status:
- **Draft:** The listing has been created but is not yet published.
- **In Progress:** The listing is published and actively accepting submissions.
- **In Review:** The submission deadline has passed, and the sponsor is now reviewing the submissions.
- **Payment Pending:** The sponsor has selected the recipient(s), but payment or verification is still pending.
- **Completed:** The sponsor has processed and verified payment to the recipient(s).
- **Deleted:** The listing has been hidden from the platform (typically an admin action or for listings that are no longer relevant and were never activated/completed).

### Filter and Search

You can easily filter your listings by their [type](../opportunities.md) (Bounties, Projects, Sponsorships) or current status to quickly find what you need.

### Quick Actions & Edits

The listings table offers a clear summary of each opportunity (name, submission count, deadline, prize, status) and provides direct links to edit listings or view their respective submissions, streamlining your management process.

## Submissions

All submissions and applications for your opportunities are neatly collected in a dedicated **`Submissions`** page. This allows for consistent and organized review across all your listings for a specific sponsor identity. Or you can also view submissions within a listing.

### Advanced Review Tools

You can filter submissions or view their individual status as they move through your review pipeline.

- **Search:** Use the search function to find specific contributors or applications.
- **View Submission:** Dive deep into each submission to view comprehensive contributor details, including their NEARN profile, contact information (email), NEAR wallet address, and KYC/KYB verification status. Also view their submitted materials and answers to your custom questions, ensuring you have all the information needed for evaluation.

#### Submission Lifecycle:
- **NEW:** A fresh submission requiring sponsor action; can be edited by the submitter.
- **REVIEWED:** The submission has been looked at by the sponsor; it is now locked and cannot be edited by the submitter. Sponsor action is still required.
- **SHORTLISTED:** The submission has been marked as a potential candidate; it is locked and cannot be edited. Sponsor action is still required.
- **APPROVED:** The submission has been selected as a winner or approved for the opportunity.
- **REJECTED:** The submission has not been selected.
- **PAID:** Payment has been processed for the approved submission/participant. (This status is typically updated automatically or by the sponsor after payment actions).
- **SPAM:** The submission has been marked as spam, and the submitter may be blocked from making new submissions to that listing.
- **DELETED:** The submission has been removed (typically an admin/sponsor action).

### Collaborate on Selections

You can access the internal notes section attached to each submission for your teamâ€™s private discussions, feedback, and deliberations during the review process.
A dedicated public comments section allows for more threaded discussion if needed, keeping all communication about a submission in one place.

### Advance Selection Tools

Flexible Approval: Depending on the listing type:
- For [Bounties](../opportunities.md#bounties), select multiple winners and assign specific places (e.g., 1st, 2nd, bonus) according to your prize structure.
- For [Projects](../opportunities.md#projects), select the single best applicant/proposal to award the project to.
- For [Sponsorships](../opportunities.md#sponsorships), approve multiple individuals or teams who meet the criteria to receive support.
Automated Public Announcements: For Bounties and Projects, selected winners are automatically announced on the listing page, providing transparency and recognition. For Sponsorships, approved recipients are managed and funded as per the program's design.

### Manage Payments & Finalize

Clearly track the payment status, agreed amount, and specified currency (e.g., USDT) for each approved submission.
The system facilitates payment processing. For instance, once a sponsor adds a payment link or confirms payment through integrated methods (like the future NEAR Treasury integration), the corresponding submission's status will typically be updated to **PAID**, and the overall listing may move to **Payment Pending** or **Completed** based on whether all payments are done.
Formally conclude your engagements by marking sponsorships or other opportunities as **`Completed`** within the platform.

### Maintain Records

Export submission data to CSV at any time, either for all submissions under a sponsor or for a specific listing. This is useful for offline analysis, reporting, or archival purposes.

## Team Settings

In the **`Team Settings`** section you can view all team members, their roles, and manage pending invites.

You can add colleagues to collaborate on managing your sponsor profile(s), and assign roles like **`Admin`** (full control, including team management) or **`Member`** (manage listings, submissions, payments) to ensure efficient teamwork and secure access.
