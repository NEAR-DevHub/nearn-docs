### 3. Fill Out Details

You’ll need to provide:
- **Title:** A clear listing title to attract contributors. (e.g., "Frontend Developer for DApp")
- **Type:** The listing type ([Bounty, Project, Sponsorship](../opportunities.md))
- **Description:** Clearly explain the task, expectations, and deliverables. The rich text editor lets you customize the listing and add rich formatting for improved visual impact.

- **Rewards:** Specify the payout amount in **USDC**, **NEAR**, or another token.
  - **Bounties:** you can set up a prize pool with any number of places (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) and additional bonus prizes.
  - **Projects:** it can be a fixed compensation you decide, or applicants can send you quotes.
  - **Sponsorships:** applicants can send you quotes of any amount.
- **Deadline:** Specific deadline when the listing ends, based on your timezone. (e.g., "2 weeks to complete")
- **Skills Needed:** Specify skills needed using a clear tagging system so the right talent can find your listing. (e.g., React, TypeScript, UI/UX)
- **Point of Contact:** Provide a clear point of contact for questions. (e.g., `myemail@example.com`)
- **Custom Questions:** Add custom questions to your application forms to gather exactly the information you need from potential contributors. (e.g., _"Are you a Web3 developer?"_)
