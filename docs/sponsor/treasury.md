## Overview

The [NEAR Treasury](https://neartreasury.com) integration allows sponsors to create payment proposals directly from NEARN once a submission has been approved.

While payments are still approved and executed on NEAR Treasury, this integration streamlines the entire sponsor flow: from listing an opportunity to reviewing submissions, approving rewards, and generating a Treasury proposal. Once a payment is confirmed on-chain, NEARN will automatically reflect its status.

## Requisites

Before you can connect your Sponsor account with a [NEAR Treasury](https://neartreasury.com) instance, you need to add the special account `nearn-io.near` to your [Treasury Member List](https://docs.neartreasury.com/settings#adding-members). This allows NEARN to create payment requests when a winner is selected and payments need to be processed.

To add `nearn-io.near` to your Treasury:

1.  Open your [NEAR Treasury site](https://treasury-factory.near.page/).
2.  Navigate to the **`Settings`** page.
3.  Select the **`Members`** tab.
4.  Click the **`+ Add Member`** button.
5.  Enter the NEAR wallet address `nearn-io.near`.
6.  Choose the member's role **`Requestor`**.
7.  Click the **`Save`** button and confirm the transactions.
8.  Go to the **`Requests`** page to [approve the request](https://docs.neartreasury.com/settings#pending-requests).
