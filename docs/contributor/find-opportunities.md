## Opportunity Feed & Discovery

You can discovery opportunities by exploring the [dynamic homepage feed](https://nearn.io), featuring a wide array of [opportunities](../opportunities.md) (Bounties, Projects, Sponsorships) from various organizations across the NEAR ecosystem.

You can browse opportunities by specific categories of work (e.g., Content, Design, Development, Other) or by [opportunity types](../opportunities.md) (Bounties, Projects, Sponsorships) to narrow your search.

You can also visit individual sponsor profile pages to see all the opportunities they are currently offering.
