## Who qualifies to be a sponsor?

Any team or project that is building in the NEAR ecosystem can sponsor a listing on Nearn. Size of the team or operations don't matter â€” you can be a tokenized project or a small grantee; as long as you are building on the NEAR blockchain, you can add a listing on Nearn.

## How much money do I need to put up?

There is no upper or lower limit of the amount of money you need to put up per listing. However, the compensation offered per listing will affect the distribution (via emails, discord, platform discovery, etc.) that the listing will get.

## Who judges the bounties & projects?

The sponsors are supposed to review, announce, and pay out the winners on Nearn. It's super simple to manage your submissions, all within Nearn.

## Are there any hidden costs and charges?

None at all!

## What can I use Nearn for?

Nearn is a platform to get work done from crypto-native talent. This can be in the form of bounties (get the same work done by many people) or hiring freelancers in the form of Project listings.
Nearn can be used to get any small to medium scale task done, including but not limited to development, writing, design, research, and product feedback.
