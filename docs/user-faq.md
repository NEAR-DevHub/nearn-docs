## Who can participate on Nearn?
    
Anyone with an email address can join [Nearn](https://nearn.io)!

## What's the difference between Bounty and Project listings?
    
The main difference between bounty and project listings is the number of people who complete the scope of work. Multiple people submit in a [bounty](opportunities.md#bounties), while for a [project](opportunities.md#projects), only the selected user completes the scope of work.

## Who judges the bounties & projects?

The sponsors are supposed to review, announce, and pay out the winners on Nearn.

## Do participants receive an email confirming their application?
  
Yes. An email is sent out to the verified email address of the participant to confirm their submission.

## Can I make changes to my submission after submitting it?
    
Yes, you can edit your submission until the deadline of the listing is over.

## When working in teams, who should make the submission? All team members or just the lead?
    
Ideally, only the team lead should apply to the listing. This means less redundancy for sponsors' review, accurate numbers of actual submissions, ease of making payments, etc.

## How long does it take for winners to get announced and paid out?
    
This greatly varies on the scope of work, number of submissions, and the sponsor. However, we urge the sponsors to review and announce the winners within 7 days after the deadline.
    
## What is the payout process for the winners?
    
All sponsors have their own payout processes. Usually, once the winners are announced, the sponsor will pay out the winners on their own without contacting them, using the wallet address mentioned by the winners on their profile.

## Are there any hidden costs and charges?

None at all!

## I need help with my submission. How can I get in touch?

You can [get in touch with us](support.md) and we will get back to you ASAP.

## How do you handle disputes?
    
We encourage both parties to try to resolve disputes on their own. However, if an agreement canâ€™t be reached, please [contact us](support.md).
