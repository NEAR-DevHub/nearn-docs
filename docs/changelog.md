## Changelog

This section tracks the evolution of NEARN: find out what's new, what's fixed, or just take a trip down memory lane, remembering those bugs of yesterday.

## Jul 21, 2025

We’ve been listening closely, and the NEARN team has already closed [47 issues](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/nearn/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20closed%3A%3E2025-06-10), from bug fixes to new features.

**What’s New ✨**
  
- 🧑‍💼 [Sponsor Profiles](sponsor/profile.md): Now you can add a banner, write an about section, and customize your public profile – so contributors can learn about your team or project.

- 🤝 [Treasury Integration](sponsor/treasury.md): Sponsors can now link their NEARN account to NEAR Treasury, making it easy to manage the entire reward flow – from approved submission to on-chain payment.

- 📝 [Improved Listing Flow](sponsor/listing-guide.md): We’ve redesigned the experience to make it faster and more intuitive – with a new preview mode, clearer form sections for sponsors and contributors, and support for dropdown-style custom questions in your application forms.

Try out these new features and let us know what you think – more improvements are on the way! 🚀
