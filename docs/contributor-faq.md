## Who can participate on NEARN?
    
Anyone with an email address can join [NEARN](https://nearn.io)!

## What's the difference between Bounty and Project listings?
    
The main difference between bounty and project listings is the number of people who complete the scope of work. Multiple people submit in a [bounty](opportunities.md#bounties), while for a [project](opportunities.md#projects), only the selected user completes the scope of work.

## Who judges the bounties & projects?

The sponsors are supposed to review, announce, and pay out the winners on NEARN.

## Do participants receive an email confirming their application?
  
Yes. An email is sent out to the verified email address of the participant to confirm their submission.

## Do I need to complete a KYC process to submit applications?

No, you don't need to complete KYC to participate in NEARN.

Keep in mind that some sponsors on NEARN – like [DevHub](https://nearn.io/devhub/), [Infra Committee](https://nearn.io/infra-committee/), [Firehose](https://nearn.io/firehose/) – require KYC/KYB verification to process payments, which they manage externally through tools like SumSub, but NEARN does not manage KYC/KYB.

NEARN only checks whether the NEAR address appears on a list of verified wallets maintained by those sponsors. If your wallet doesn’t show as verified, please contact the sponsor directly.

## Can I make changes to my submission after submitting it?
    
Yes, you can edit your submission while the submission status is **New** and the listing is **In Progress**. Please note that submissions are locked once they're **Reviewed** or **Shortlisted**.

## When working in teams, who should make the submission? All team members or just the lead?
    
Ideally, only the team lead should apply to the listing. This means less redundancy for sponsors' review, accurate numbers of actual submissions, ease of making payments, etc.

## How long does it take for winners to get announced and paid out?
    
This greatly varies on the scope of work, number of submissions, and the sponsor. However, we urge the sponsors to review and announce the winners within 7 days after the deadline.
    
## What is the payout process for the winners?
    
All sponsors have their own payout processes. Usually, once the winners are announced, the sponsor will pay out the winners on their own without contacting them, using the wallet address mentioned by the winners on their profile. For enhanced visibility and tracking, the NEARN platform allows sponsors to mark submissions as **PAID** when they send a payment.

## I want to be a Sponsor too, should I register again?

No, you don't need to register again. Your registered user account can be used for both roles. (Contributor and Sponsor)

## Are there any hidden costs and charges?

None at all!

## I need help with my submission. How can I get in touch?

You can [get in touch with the NEARN Support team](support.md) and we will get back to you ASAP.

## How do you handle disputes?
    
We encourage both parties to try to resolve disputes on their own. However, if an agreement can’t be reached, please [contact us](support.md).
